      ## What does this thing do?

      This [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) sample application
      demonstrates how to send SMS alerts to a list of system
      administrators if something goes wrong on your server. In this
      tutorial, we'll show you the key bits of code to make this work.
      Head to the [application's
      README.md](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/server-notifications-node)
      to see how to run the application locally.

      ## Configure Twilio client

      In order to send messages we'll need to create a [Twilio REST
      client](http://twilio.github.io/twilio-node/#quickstart), which
      requires reading our `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_NUMBER`
      `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` from the enviroment. We also make the
      variables available through the `config` module.

      ## List server admins

      Here we create a list of administrators who should be notified if a
      server error occurs.  The only essential piece of data we need is a
      `phoneNumber` for each administrator.

      ## Handle all the exceptions in the application

      We will implement error handling and message delivery as a piece
      of [Express.js
      middleware](http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html). We
      will make all the Twilio API calls from there.

    :markdown
      ## Trigger notifications for administrator list

      In our Express middleware module, we read the admins from our JSON file
      and send alert messages to each of them with the `sendSms` method in 
      `twilioClient`. We also call `next` with the error object, which will
      allow other configured error handling middleware to execute.

      ## Send a text message

      There are the three parameters needed to [send an
      SMS](http://twilio.github.io/twilio-node/#moreexamples)
      using the [Twilio REST
      API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest): `From`, `To`, and
      `Body`. [US and Canadian phone
      numbers](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/sms/is-mms-supported-for-all-carriers-in-us-and-canada)
      can also send an image with the message.

      ## Where to next?

      That's it! We've just implemented an automated server notification system 
      that can send you server alerts if anything goes wrong. If you're a Node.js
      developer working with Twilio, you might want to check out these other
      tutorials.
